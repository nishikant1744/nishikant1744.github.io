# Nishikant Nemade
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineering graduate already dived into the world of Data Analytics at the University of Strathclyde. My passion lies in blending traditional engineering skills with modern data science to solve real-world problems.
ðŸ”§ Skills & Tools
â€¢	Mechanical Engineering: Quality assurance, defect analysis, casting inspections.
â€¢	Data Analytics: Python, Machine Learning, Big Data tools.
â€¢	Project Management: Collaborating across teams to maintain high standards and deliver impactful results.
ðŸ“š Projects
Hereâ€™s a snapshot of some projects Iâ€™ve been working on:
â€¢	Metastasis Detection in Histopathology Images
Used deep learning to detect metastatic breast cancer, focusing on binary classification and making the model understandable.
â€¢	UK Accident Statistics Analysis
Analyzed accident data from 2016-2020 using Python to find patterns and insights.
â€¢	Healthcare Sector Analysis
Investigated issues in Scottish healthcare and provided data-driven recommendations for improvement.
â€¢	Spotify Data Analysis
Worked with a team to predict song popularity and classify genres using machine learning, sharing results on Kaggle.
â€¢	AI System for Surgical Safety
Developed a deep learning tool to help surgeons identify critical anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, improving patient outcomes.
ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On
Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge in Big Data, Machine Learning, and Business Decision Modelling. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to apply these skills to practical problems.
ðŸ’¡ Letâ€™s Collaborate!
Iâ€™m excited about projects that bring together engineering and data analytics. If youâ€™re working on something cool or need a collaborator, feel free to reach out!
